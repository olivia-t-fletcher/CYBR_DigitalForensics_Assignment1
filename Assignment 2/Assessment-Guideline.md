# CYBR472 Assignment 2: Digital Forensics
***

## Overview
This assignment has two parts and is worth 40% of your final grade:
* Lab work – the aim is to develop practical skills that will be applied in the case study – this should take about 10 hours.
* Questions and implementations – help you engage with the theory and its application – this part should take about another 10 hours.

## Tasks
This assignment aims to make you familiar with tools and techniques that can be applied in forensic acquisition, examination and analysis processes while assessing your understanding of the theoretical concepts. 

## Part 1 [50 marks]
Go to netlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz
Log in using your netlab username and password and complete the following TEN labs. Write a blog-style entry that reflects on the following points. Each blog Entry should not be more than 300 words total. 
* Something that you have learnt or discovered by doing lab work
* Explain how this illustrates or expands upon something you learnt in the course lecture or reading
Labs:
[x] - Lab 03: Live Forensics   
[x] - Lab 10: Steganography and Alternative Data Streams  
[x] - Lab 11: Picture File Analysis  
[x] - Lab 12: Email Analysis  
[x] - Lab 15: IoT Forensics  
[x] - Lab 14: Timeline Analysis   
[x] - Lab 16: Mobile Forensic Analysis  
[x] - Lab 17: Log Capturing and Interpretation  
[x] - Lab 18: Pagefile Analysis  
[x] - Lab 19: Password Cracking	  

## Part 2 [25 marks]
After completion of the above labs, answer the following questions:
* [5 Marks] What does "deleting" a file really mean in terms of file system and storage drive (e.g. magnetic drive) operations?
* [5 Marks] What happens when you move a file to Recycle Bin on a file system level and does it affect the acquisition and forensic process?
* [5 Marks] Explain how you can identify the format and fix a graphics file which the forensics tool you are using is not able to recognize and open.
* [5 Marks] Explain the two different types of steganography and how they are performed.
* [5 Marks] Explain how the future of IoT devices will impact digital forensics and an examiner's response to an event involving one or multiple connected devices

## Part 3
* [10 Marks] Analyse the attached email and extract all possible information which could be used in a forensic investigation.
* [5 Marks] Examine the fields and determine where the message originated from. Briefly explain each step.
* [10 Marks] Write a script (Any programming language) to automate the process of extracting images from the attached Thumbs.zip file.

## Written Report - Myserious Malware
For this part, you will need to set up a proper network for the malware being analysed to perform communication with a command-and-control centre if required. In your report, you do not need to describe the process of how and why you designed your network. However, you will need to demonstrate your observations regarding any network and disk activities.
Most importantly, you need to utilise BOTH basic and advanced static and dynamic malware analysis tools to identify various indicators. Hence, you should perform a complete analysis of the malware in this section.
Analyse the malware found in CYBR473Malware.zip malware (the password is infected) and consider the following points:
* Network design and deployment 
* Malware information, e.g., compilation time, and existing antivirus signatures, including, ClamAV 
* Obfuscation 
* Malware type and purpose 
* System indicators & Network indicators
* Code decompilation possibility 
You should be clear about which tools were used and how they were used. Make sure you reference where you can obtain or read more about these tools/techniques/approaches so that your analysis can be repeated. Furthermore, make sure to provide a coherent document that covers these aforementioned points instead of a Q&A style. Please feel free regarding the organisation of the report, i.e., sectioning. However, you might find it easier to use the points above as the main sections. Alternatively, you can also group various points under different sections.
